### Observational Oceanography

Since 2002, I've worked in a total of seven open ocean cruises of 7-10 days duration, at Brazilian Navy and [IOUSP](http://www.io.usp.br) ships, at Southwest Atlantic offshore Brazil's Southeast and East coasts. Most of the cruises were focused in CTD and VM-ADCP quasi-synoptic sampling arrays with the goal of investigating mesoscale activity of the outer continental shelf and Brazil Current western boundary system. Besides participation in standard data aquisition and navigation procedures, also real time data analysis and plotting were perfomed during most of these cruises.

### Research

My major research focus since my undergrads has been mesoscale dynamics associated with western boundary currents, addressed by satellite and in situ data and numerical modeling. From Jan/2012 to Apr/2014, I've worked as a physical oceanography research Fellow at [IEAPM](http://www.ieapm.mar.mil.br), a Brazilian Navy Research Institution, where the main focus of my work was on modeling and data analysis of coastal upwelling systems and developing GUI softwares for data qualification, visualization and storage.

### Teaching

During 2009 I was a short term professor at University of the State of Rio de Janeiro ([FAOC-UERJ](http://www.oceanografia.uerj.br)). I was responsible for Data Analysis in Physical Oceanography course for undergraduate students. It was a total of two semesters with 10h/week classes. I was a TA for four semesters at University of São Paulo ([IOUSP](http://www.io.usp.br)) undergraduation courses Dynamical Physical Oceanography, General Circulation and Coastal and Estuarine Physical Oceanography. I also regularly lecture on *Scientific Programming with Python* for graduate and undergraduate levels.  

### Associate Professor

In October 2013 I became an Associate professor at the Graduation Program of the State University of Rio de Janeiro ([FAOC-UERJ](http://www.oceanografia.uerj.br)). I am collaborating with the Data Analysis in Physical Oceanography course and available as an advisor for M.Sc. students. Please access the Graduation website for more information.

### Current position

I'm currently working as a hydrodynamical modeller using ROMS at [MetOcean](http://metocean.co.nz), and also part of a team of developers and maintaners of a multidisciplinary operational system for dissemination of atmospheric and oceanic forecast and hindcast regional high resolution datasets.
