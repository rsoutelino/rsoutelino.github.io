### Observational Oceanography

Since 2002, I've worked in a total of seven open ocean cruises of 7-10 days duration, at Brazilian Navy and [IOUSP](http://www.io.usp.br) ships, at Southwest Atlantic offshore Brazil's Southeast and East coasts. Most of the cruises were focused in CTD and VM-ADCP quasi-synoptic sampling arrays with the goal of investigating mesoscale activity of the outer continental shelf and Brazil Current western boundary system. Besides participation in standard data aquisition and navigation procedures, also real time data analysis and plotting were perfomed during most of these cruises.

### Research interests

My major research focus since my undergrads has been mesoscale dynamics associated with western boundary currents, addressed by satellite and *in situ* data and numerical modeling. Currently the main focus of my work is on modeling and data analysis of dynamics of coastal upwelling systems 

### Other interests

Operational oceanography, hydrodynamical modelling and scientific programming mainly with Python. Developing GUI softwares for data qualification, visualization and storage. Developing information tecnologic systems to run models and its verification, and build spatial and temporal graphical data presentations.
