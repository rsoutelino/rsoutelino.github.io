### Research interests

My major research focus since my undergrads has been mesoscale dynamics associated with western boundary currents, addressed by satellite and **in situ** data and numerical modeling. Currently the main focus of my work is on modeling and data analysis of dynamics of coastal upwelling systems 

### Other interests

Operational oceanography, hydrodynamical modelling and scientific programming mainly with Python. Developing GUI softwares for data qualification, visualization and storage. Developing information tecnologic systems to run models and its verification, and build spatial and temporal graphical data presentations.
