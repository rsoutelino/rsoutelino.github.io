> Não sou nada. Nunca serei nada, não posso querer ser nada. À parte isso, tenho em mim todos os sonhos do mundo.
**Fernando Pessoa, Portuguese Poet.**

My name is Cesar B. Rocha. I grew up in the gigantic and jammed Sao Paulo in the southeast of Brazil. I went to school at [University of Sao Paulo][usp] (USP) where I studied science.  I was also an exchange student in the physics department of [University of Massachusetts Darthmouth][umass]. At USP I've met awesome friends and I fell in love with applied mathematics, data science, and free software. I also have become aware of social issues in the world. This may sound  cliché but I'm committed to apply my skills to improve the world.

I'm currently a second-year PhD student in the Climate-Ocean-Atmosphere Program at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography][scripps], University of California, San Diego. I'm mainly (but not exclusively) interested in geophysical fluid dynamics and physical oceanography. I use a mix of theory, computational simulations, and analysis of observations to unravel how the ocean works.

I started programming in my sophomore year in high school (C and C++). In college I took one more class in C (the required CS class for science majors), and picked up Octave/Matlab, bash, and Fortran 90 doing research; I also learned a bit of [Python](https://www.python.org) along the way. When I moved to Scripps, I completely abandoned Matlab and never looked back. Python is a true scripting language, and, among other things, it's free and open, just like science should be. Be aware: I'm a Python evangelist ! For heavy duty calculations, I use Fortran 90 and C.

True facts: I'm a coffee aficionado. I have much more books than friends. I read [The New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com) every Sunday. I'm very ambitious, super career-oriented, and outrageously workaholic. I'm brazilian but I'm a terrible soccer player, and I don't like Carnival. I rest my mind by listening bossa nova, or watching piano concerts on youtube.
